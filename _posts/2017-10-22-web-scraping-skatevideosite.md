### How my love for skateboarding taught me a bunch about coding

Skateboarding has brought me a tremendous amount of joy in my life. While I'm definately not the bruised & battered 12 year old skaterat I used to be, I still consider it a crucial cornerstone of my character. One of my favorite things to do as a skateboarder (and probably all skaters) is watching cool footage of other people do it. Needless to say, I've watched hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of hours of skating through out my life.  One of the side effects of this has been a huge exposure to a lot of really, really good music.

Thankfully, the good folks at skatevideosite.com has cataloged about 30,000 songs from about 3000 different videos over the years. I've been going to this website for a while now to discover new music and old. Having said all that, I've been trying to get into coding and have been looking for cool projects that would kind of propel a natural curiosity in something else I already had.
