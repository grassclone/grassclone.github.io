title: Web scraping skatevideosite.com
---



I scraped all of the artist/song data off of [skatevideosite.com](http://www.skatevideosite.com) using scrapy. Ultimately was able to end up with [this tracks.csv file](https://github.com/grassclone/grassclone.github.io/blob/master/tracks.csv). There's around 20k tracks listed in there. Which is interesting because the website claims to have over 30k listed on their site. As far as I know my spider collected everything so I'm not really sure where they got their numbers from.


This simple little project taught me about quite a few different things:

1. Python/Scrapy
2. Web scraping
3. Github/github pages
5. Markdown/Jekyll
6. SQL/looking at data
